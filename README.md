# isaac's reading list

This is a list of books that I have found useful in my gradual/ongoing
transition from software developer to startup founder.

If there's something that you think I ought to read, then open an
issue.

This is not a comprehensive list of every book I've read on any of
these subjects.  Just the ones that I can wholeheartedly recommend
because they are interesting, entertaining, and/or educational enough
to be worth the experience.

I have a strong preference towards audiobooks rather than paper or
kindle.  Audio means I can consume it while doing things that occupy
my hands, like commuting or going to the gym.
